        <p>
           Women in Ancient Egypt were given<br>
           the same legal rights as men, which<br>
           in some cases allowed them to ascednd<br>
           the throne and rule over Egypt as a<br>
           queen. In fact, Ancient Egypt granted<br>
           more women into power than anywhere<br>
           else in the world.
