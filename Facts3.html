            Pyramids were used as tombs for Pharos.

        <p>
            When Pharos died, they were mummified<br>
            and placed into coffins. Those coffins<br>
            would then be placed into Pyramids,<br>
            and the Pharo's coffins would be<br>
            surrounded by gold and riches so that<br>
            they could make it into the afterlife.<br>
            Sadly many tombs have been raided and<br>
            robbed, so most pyramids that we've<br>
            been able to enter are empty.
